    The main Bitbucket client class providing access to all Bitbucket operations.

    This class inherits from multiple mixins that provide specific functionality:
    - UsersMixin: User-related operations and authentication validation
    - WorkspacesMixin: Workspace-related operations and filtering
    - RepositoriesMixin: Repository operations, file content, and directory listing
    - BranchesMixin: Branch operations and commit history
    - PullRequestsMixin: Pull request operations and related functionality

    The class follows the same mixin architecture pattern as JiraFetcher and ConfluenceFetcher,
    providing a unified interface for all Bitbucket API operations while maintaining
    separation of concerns through focused mixins.
